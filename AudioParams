AudioParam.linearRampToValueAtTime()
	var AudioParam = AudioParam.linearRampToValueAtTime(value, endTime)
	value
	    A floating point number representing the value the AudioParam will ramp to by the given time.
	endTime
	    A double representing the exact time (in seconds) after the ramping starts that the changing of the value will stop.

setTargetAtTime
var paramRef = param.setTargetAtTime(target, startTime, timeConstant);

Parameters

target
    The value the parameter will start to transition towards at the given start time.
startTime
    The time that the exponential transition will begin, in the same time coordinate system as AudioContext.currentTime. If it is less than or equal to AudioContext.currentTime, the parameter will start changing immediately.
timeConstant
    The time-constant value, given in seconds, of an exponential approach to the target value. The larger this value is, the slower the transition will be.
